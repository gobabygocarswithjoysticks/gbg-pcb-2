# GBG PCB

# A PCB for controlling the motors in a [go baby go car with joystick control](https://gobabygocarswithjoysticks.github.io/index/)

[![Process KiCad](https://github.com/gobabygocarswithjoysticks/gbg-pcb/actions/workflows/process-kicad.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gobabygocarswithjoysticks/gbg-pcb/actions/workflows/process-kicad.yml)

V2.1

This board replaces the control box of a car's original electronics or the separate ESCs and Arduino in the [usual joystick modification](https://gobabygocarswithjoysticks.github.io/index/). The board has screw terminals for connecting to the battery, motors, and the joystick. With this circuit board, a car can be converted to joystick control without any soldering.

Voltage input: 5 to 26 volts (6v, 12v, and 24v lead acid batteries, absolute maximum 4.6V-28V)

Controls two motors: one for each wheel so that the car can turn in place.

[New in version 2](https://gobabygocarswithjoysticks.github.io/gbg-pcb/instructions/instructions#new-in-v2-weelye-control-box-compatible): A V2 GBG-PCB can be configured with battery, motor, and signal plugs that match the plugs on the common weelye control boxes. This means some cars can be converted to joystick control without cutting any wires. V2 GBG-PCBs also run fron 6 to 24 volt batteries.

### For the previous versions of the GBG-PCB see https://github.com/gobabygocarswithjoysticks/gbg-pcb/tree/version_1 
Version 1 GBG-PCBs had a higher, 10 amp current capacity and a lower part count but requires 12 volts.

### This keeps you from needing to solder the joystick wires to a 4 wire cable.

# notes for people working on the KiCAD for this project
Use KiCAD 10.0

Run [this github action](https://github.com/gobabygocarswithjoysticks/gbg-pcb/actions/workflows/process-kicad.yml) when you push changes to any of the KiCAD files. The action updates the images of the CAD, the gerber files, the schematic, and other PCB production files.
