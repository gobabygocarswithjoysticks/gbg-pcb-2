# GBG PCB
## work in progress. this will be updated after the boards are tested.
* Update for v1.0: the motor drivers work, the circuit board supplied 15A from one motor port for 4 minutes without overheating, the reverse voltage protection MOSFETS need to be redesigned for v1.1
* Update for v1.1: waiting to receive boards
