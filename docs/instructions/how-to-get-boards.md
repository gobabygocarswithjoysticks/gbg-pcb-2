## Buy fully assembled boards from a PCB manufacturer
At this time I have not tried to buy fully assembled boards from a PCB manufacturer. I have generated a [position.csv](https://github.com/gobabygocarswithjoysticks/gbg-pcb/blob/main/PCB_production/position.csv) file that would be needed for the pick and place machine
## Buy PCBs and a solder stencil and solder all the parts yourself
exported files for gerbers and solder masks are here: https://github.com/gobabygocarswithjoysticks/gbg-pcb/tree/main/PCB_production
## Email gobabygocarswithjoysticks@gmail.com
I might have fully assembled boards to sell or donate to you.
